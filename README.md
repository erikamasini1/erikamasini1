 Hi Everyone 👋
 
🙋🏻‍♀️ I am Erika Masini, a Full Stack Developer, looking for new opportunities and professional challenges in this fascinating world.

🔭 I am also a chemical engineer, and currently finishing an MBA, with several experiences in the manufacturing industries where I had
great opportunities of leading several group of people and develop the abilities of team work, management, cost reduction, working
under pressure. What I value the most of my professional experience is having worked with people from all over the world. I am looking forward to find a place where I can merge my experience and this new passion of programing I am getting into. 

🌎 I am fond of travelling, exploring and living in different cultures is the best way to broaden your mind! and if possible learn a bit of new languages as well.
